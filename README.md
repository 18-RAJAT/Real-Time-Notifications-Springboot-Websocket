# Real-Time Notifications in Spring Boot Using WebSocket

## Overview
This repository contains a Spring Boot application that demonstrates how to build a real-time notification system using WebSocket technology. It provides an efficient solution for delivering instant updates to clients, such as chat applications, order tracking systems, live collaboration tools, and event-based notifications.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Communication**: Enables bi-directional communication between clients and the WebSocket server.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Facilitates bulk updates and notification triggers.
- **Versatile Use Cases**: Covers chat messages, order tracking, system alerts, and collaborative events.
- **Scalable Design**: Integrates with backend services for reliable processing and queuing.

## Architecture Overview
The system architecture is designed with modular components to ensure flexibility and scalability:
1. **User Interaction Layer**:
   - Includes Desktop, Mobile, and Web clients.
   - Establishes bi-directional WebSocket connections for real-time updates.

2. **WebSocket Server**:
   - Centralized server built using Spring Boot.
   - Manages session handling, message broadcasting, and serialization.

3. **Backend Services**:
   - Handles order management, queue processing, and admin-triggered notifications.
   - Ensures reliability using message queues.

4. **Admin Panel**:
   - Provides tools for admins to send notifications and perform bulk updates.

## How It Works
1. **Clients Connect**: Clients (e.g., mobile apps, web browsers) establish a WebSocket connection with the server.
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Notifications such as chat messages, order updates, and alerts are broadcasted to connected clients.
3. **Admin Actions**: The admin dashboard triggers bulk actions, such as updating order statuses or sending system-wide messages.
4. **Backend Processing**: Order updates and events are processed through backend services, ensuring consistent and reliable delivery.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Core framework for building the WebSocket server.
- **WebSocket (STOMP)**: Protocol for real-time, bi-directional communication.
- **Frontend (Optional)**: Example static web clients for testing WebSocket connections.
- **Message Queues**: Optional integration with RabbitMQ or Kafka for reliability.
